                    <h4>
                        I am a front end developer that enjoys transforming
                        static websites to clean responsive sites.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The interest in problem-solving computer issues arose in
                        my early teenage years. It wasn't until I was done with
                        teaching when I took the path to web development. When
                        Iâ€™m away from my computer, I enjoy being outdoors
                        walking to the beach, and harvesting from our farm with
                        my son.
                    </p>
                    <p class="last-par">Looking foward to working together!</p>
                </div>

        </section>
